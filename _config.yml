          Weekday afternoon and weekend morning news anchor for **Lansing 1320 WILS**. Wrote and recorded hourly news segments of up to 90 seconds on:

            I also attend <mark>City Council</mark> meetings to conduct exclusive <mark>interviews</mark> with council members.

          During my time at the station, I have suggested and implemented changes to bring news pieces in line with current AP style guide recommendations for reporting on <mark>LGBTQ+</mark> related topics.
          These changes have since been implemented by the head of the station during his own news segments.

          **Click microphone icons for additional wraps**. These pages include scripts of my most recent work for 1320 WILS reporting on local news and politics. These scripts are **not intended to be read as news articles**; they are copy for radio. However, I include them because I was in charge of researching, writing, and recording the stories from beginning to end.
